Here&#039;s a Pad Thai recipe that really does taste just as good as takeout from good Thai restaurants, and you&#039;ll find everything you need at the supermarket. See here for a truly authentic Pad Thai recipe, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re after - but note that most people find it a little too &quot;real&quot; for their palettes because Pad Thai outside of Thailand is dialled back on the fish sauce/dried shrimp &quot;funk&quot;.I use chicken here but feel free to switch with any protein, even prawns/shrimp.\u00a0",
